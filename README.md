# 🚁 DroneVision

**DroneVision** is an AI-powered drone monitoring system designed to automate the assessment of road construction progress. It leverages aerial images captured by drones and applies deep learning (U-Net) for road segmentation, followed by progress calculation using image comparison. This eliminates the need for manual site visits and enables fast, accurate, and cost-effective monitoring.
